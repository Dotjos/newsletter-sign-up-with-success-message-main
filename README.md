## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt the integratyion of tailwind css to HTML, how amazing tailwind css is and it's Doc and also how to build projects on your own totally from scratch alone,with the help of google and other sources though. 



### Continued development

Will tackle one more frontend.io mentor challenge with the exact stacks I used in this project before moving to learn REACT JSüòäüòÅ.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Tailwind document helped with easy implementation of the css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/) - ChatGPT helped answering some algorithimic questions. I'd recommend it to anyone into programming.
